# Culture Difference & Prejudice

#### What is the difference

- **Race is an example of difference**
- Culture difference is not given biologically, it is given by **culture itself and history**
- ==Difference is **dynamic** and changing, prejudice it has to do with difference and similarities==
- <u>Prejudice</u> -- (偏见) people don't hate all people that are different.

## Culture and Language

### Universal patterns

- Communication, imagination, identity
- <u>Cultural</u> -- What **we learn from each other 
 vs. what was "program" by genes**  
- Genes allows humans to **"have cultures"** because all difference groups of humans have culture (even though its different)
   - <mark>Genes **enable**, but **not detersmine** ***culture-specific*** ways of acting, living and thinking</mark>
- Cultural allows humans to form **procreative** relationships
   - Most importantly, is the marriage patterns (how human reproduce)
- Cultural helps human to recognizing hierarchy - how people understand & fight hierarchy
- Cultural also deals with violence (some resistance within cultures creates violence)
   - Might have to use violence to suppress violence
- The way sharing the giving happens
- Education is also **a characteristic of every Cultural** 
   - Each Cultural's idea of education is different (associated with language)

### Particulars

- Cultures are **significantly different**, but **not infinitely different**
> ##### Reflection of the weekly readings
> - "The French complain a lot (?), but are they the only ones
> - The article **didn't have enough scientific proof** that France is the only country
> - But the purpose of complain can be explained scientifically by linguistics

### Language

- ==A **distinctively human resource and a central element** of Cultural, used for:==
   - Creates **meanings**, and helps human understand differently (**signification**)
   - Helps **adapting** to the natural and social environment
   - Helps humans to structure imagination & shape the way they see the world
- Like cultures, languages have more in **common** than not
- Very language has the basic **grammatic** rules (nouns & verbs)
   - All languages' order of word matters
- Language reflect current social-[[Cultural]] contexts

### ==Adaptive values of social transmission==

- Social transmission is much more **flexible** than genetic transmission:
   - Major cultures & language changes can occur in a generation or two
   - Major language changes can also occur in a generation or two
   - This means that it is **much more adaptive than the genetic process**
   - Result: if successful, adaptation occurs without human becoming a new species (major change occur within species)
- Gives the potential to remain and preserve in the world

### Adaptive value of sociocultural difference

- Specific languages and cultures develop to cope with specific environmental and social contexts (niches)
   - The natural adaptive process to **fit into the environment**

> ##### Examples of adaptive language
>
> - Does the word "<u>love</u>" and "marriage" change the way people treat love itself?
>
> - <u>Potlatch</u> - Northwestern American (Western Canada, including BC)
>   - Facility people come together, to give away valuable product. The person who gives the most valuable thing, becomes most respected (leader)
>   - Because people there are not rich, so it's their specific way of determine authority
> - <u>Brideswealth/dowry</u> (during marriage)
>   - Brides-wealth(彩礼) -- men gives something to the women's family (China)
>   - Dowry(嫁妆) -- women's family gives something to the men's family (Western cultural) 

### Difference and Conflict

- "When people is different, they will flight"
   - Differences is a source of conflict, but it doesn't has to be
- Difference can be **adaptive, but also destructive**
- ==Within all species, groups can come into conflict, often due to **distribution of resources**==
   - The resources may be natural or social (can be conscious, but doesn't have to be)
      - Social conflicts (jobs, political influence, education, right of residence(citizenship, immigration issues))
   - The competing groups may be social classes or ethnoracial(religion, race) groups
      - They may live in same or different locations
   - Due to the conflicts, **even if the resources are distributed evenly after**, prejudice still remains
      - Prejudices about the other only happens where there is present or past conflict that **still effect on the current population**

- ==Differences can lead to prejudice==
  - Differences may be accompanied by prejudice about the other (only if there is present or past competition of resources)
  - **Prejudice does not come from difference but from its context**

## Race

### Defintion

- **If words of difference races did not exit, then the context of <u>race</u> would not exist**
  - Diversity would still bother, but we wouldn't "see" it as racial
- ==Race is a Cultural definition (**folk notion**), not a scientific notion (no genes determine race)==
  - Race is real, it **exist**, but it's **popularly** defined
- Race is not (only) based on physical appearance, are correlated with genetic traits
  - These differences are **not consistency enough to justify scientifically** of race
  - There exist more variation other than skin color across within races
    - Skin color became the key feature due to historical reasons
  - The popular definition of race are imprecise and **changeable**, reflecting the social context and history of conflict

### Social application 

- Non-white groups: if any non-white "blood" appears, then it wouldn't be referred as white
  - "<u>One -Drop Rule</u>" -- if any block blood appears, then it is refered to as black
  - Human do differ differences, which creates Cultural **discrimination**
- When people refer to white people, it's not referring to a "color" (in racial terminology)
  - Its a default, or <u>*unmarked*</u> term (the indicator of **privilege**)
  - The term "*white*" meant freedom and privalige (race would not be a issue)
  - White privilege : "Your life is not made harder when you are white." (Nasar Meer, Professor of Race)

### its real, its invented, but its naturalized

- Race is a <u>social construction</u> , its not part of nature, but it is determined by society. Its <u>invented</u>, but <u>naturalized</u> by the society

- <u>**Social construction**</u> - the source of ideas and arrangements that are not given by nature
- **<u>Invented</u>** - ideas that are the result of social construction - does not mean its not real
- <u>**Naturalization**</u> - people come to think of what was socially constructed as if it were given by nature
  - Its often imposes socially constructed categories on nature
- Not a personal matter, hard to personal construct

> Other examples (national identities, genes roles)

- The role of anthropology is to **unravel** the social constructedness of invented (but real) categories like race, national identity, or gender and discover their **genealogy** (condition of possiblity)

### Power Relations

- Racial classification are made in context of **relations of power** within society
- Difference of skin colour does not necessarily refer to different categories of race
- Race meant ***imagined common descent***
  - Includes: English race, Irish race, Chinese race...
  - ==*Black race and white* were <u>invented</u> along with slavery in America==

> Ex: *Casta* painting - illustrates the anxiety Mexican experienced with Spanish about their race
>
> - Spanish marries a Mexican women, their child becomes white again

- While entitlement is a **<u>systemic</u>** discrimination
  - Not always obvious, not just personal, not necessarily conscious, not necessarily internal
