# Relatedness

### Readings

- A society must assign individual names, identities, roles, interests, and statuses. This entails establishing and perpetuating corporate groups.
- Kinship is one universal way of making and maintaining such groups. (not the only way)
- **3 principles of kinship system: Marriage; Residence; Descent (血统)**
- Other sub-issues such as gender, domestic, and property relations with the interconnections they make significantly shape the experience of the society.
- In addition, non-kinship characters can also be sued to create corporate groups 
    - Sex/gender, age, race, common interest, class/socio-economic status.

## People who are "special"

- ==Kinship - the fundamental form of relatedness==
    - **<u>Consanguineal</u>** - by descent, united "blood"
    - **<u>Affinal</u>** - by marriage, your own or someone else's
    - These are not imagined community, but it is the model of imagined communities (the ideal "brotherhood)
        - Potentially excludes others (only includes the people within the brotherhood)
- Lewis Henry Morgan: believes family is the **building block of modern society**
- Franz Boas: father of American Anthropology (An Anthropologist's Credo)
    - "It is conviction that the fundamental ethical point of view is that of the in-group, which must be expanded to include all humanity."
- "All men shall be brothers" - by **<u>Friedrich Schiller</u>**, version of the poem "<u>Ode to Joy</u>" set to music in <u>Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony</u>
    - `Can all people be brothers`

## Descent groups (family & kin)

- **<u>Corporate</u>** groups: share identity, economic and other practical functions, may share residence; act as a unit towards others. 

  - The basic building block of social organization
  - Society: a group of groups

- **Descent** is essentially biological, but it can be **<u>ascribed</u>**

  > Adoption, fostering (in Pulau Langkawi, eating together)

### Lineages

- **<u>Patrilineage</u>** - everyone descended from same male line (mother is not part of the lineage)

- **<u>Matrilineage</u>** - reckoned on the female side only (father is not part of the lineage)

  - Most matrilineage society is still patriarchy based
  - Most powerful male relative is Mother's Brother (more than father)

  > Wendat (Wyandot, Huron), Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)

- Kinship systems is **classified differently in different societies** (even with biological relationships such as "mother" and "father")

  - The Hawaiian, Sudanese, and **Inuit (Eskimo)** system:

    - Triangle - male; Circle - female; "ego" - the centre of perspective; "=" - marriage 
    - ==first 3 on test==

## Different relatedness

- Emotion (**affect**) towards people with the **same kinship role tends** to be similar

  - Traditional Hawaiian daughter would feel much the same about her biological mother and her biological aunts
  - ==**Feelings of kinship are *socially constructed*** (doesn't mean its not real)==
    - Can be defined by imaged "substance" (blood, - "blood relations")

  > "I'm my own grandpa" - the marriages mentioned are legal but culturally inappropriate (bit Incest)

- Residence - multiple families live in the House. Hearth is where women spend most of their lives, don't normally eat elsewhere

  - People recognize belonging to the same house as a relationship

- ==**<u>Commensality</u>** (eating together) strengths the relationship among members of the house==

  - Important in building forms fo relatedness, cross-culturally
  - **Performs, conforms and creates relationships**
  - Siblings are conceived of people who eat together

  > Relatedness among Malay in Pulau Langkawi (by Janet Carsten) (Won)
  >
  > - Argued in 1995 for overlap between the social and the biological in Malay relatedness
  > - "The core substance of kinship in local perceptions is **blood**, and the major contribution to blood is **food**" (especially rice)

- Siblings

  - The placenta is considered as a younger sibling (until "real" sibling is born), buried near house
    - Because they are both nourished by the mother's blood in the womb (become milk)
  - Uterus - the siblings' first house; placenta - child's first commensal relation

- Fostering relations

  - Common in Palau Langkawi, very common among Indigenous group is Canada
    - ***Milk siblings*** - people who had drunk the same mother's milk
    - Marriage among milk sibling would be *incestuous*
  - Commensality then would create the relatedness 
  - Contributes to flexibility of relatedness

- Relatedness is the result of **social behaviour as well as brith**

- Actual relationships does not determine degree of relatedness

  > - Palau Langkawi: living in the house or moved out
  > - Toronto: sister or half-sister

## Marriage patterns

- A reproductive alliance between families (does not need legal connection)

- Does not just involve the two (or more) people married, its involve their entire family

- The basic element for perpetuating relatedness Mong different descent groups (families)

- Legal marriage is only one form of what anthropologists call marriage

- Find marriage partner

  - **Independent self-selection** (love marriage)

  - **Arranged marriage** - (exchange of women between allied families, conducted by men) 

    - Sometimes for practical considerations (economic, health...) [wealth is important]

      > Kerala Brahmin Wedding

### Types of marraige

- **<u>Exogamy</u>** - marry outside the group 

  > Gender, close kin (defined by each society), longhouse group (Amazon river "tribes")

- **<u>Endogamy</u>** - marry within the group

  > Age, social class, religion, "race" or ethnic group

- May be absolute and/or legal, or relative and informal

- Same-sex marriage
  - Typically the result of self-selection
  - Legalized in many contemporary jurisdictions
  - Informal same-sex marriage is older and more widespread than legal same-sex marriage
  - **<u>Two-spirited</u>** - LGBTQ, non-binary behaviors in indigenous marriage alliances
    - Many traditional indigenous groups in North America were very flexible on the relationship between physiology and gender roles
