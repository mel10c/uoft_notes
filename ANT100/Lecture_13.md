# The Digital Revolution

> Post-industrial society in the digital age

## Human-machine-animal coexistence

- Purpose of machine: help humans
- But we **fear that this might lead to distraction** of human itself (Ai, Robots, Frankenstein)
- Animal to human transplants

## Cultural effects of digital technology:

- **<u>Social suite</u>** - love, friendship, cooperation, and teaching

  - Can AI, robots have it?

- Arab Spring: Tunisia: Cliams were made that revolutions there happened because of social media 

  - Authorities made use of social media

- Collection <u>big data</u> - huge databases, ideally the totality of information that is transmitted

  - Collected by government (NSA) and private organizations

### Surveillance

- Yuval Hariri - "our brain are hacked"
- ==<u>Explosion</u>==- social media (**everyone can broadcast message**)
- ==<u>Implosion</u>== - **separate** different media user to **different networks**
- Not always a bad thing (ex. Track COVID info)

## Democracy, hegemony, surveillance

- Fragmentation of the public
  - Proliferation of ways to access information
  - The democratization fo information media has led to viral **spread of anti-democratic message** and other sorts of misinformation

### Hegemony [领导权]

- Before social media

  - **<u>Spontaneous</u>** consent given by the great masses of the population to the general direction imposed on social life by the dominant fundamental group. This consent is 'historically' caused by the ==**<u>prestige</u>**== which the dominant group enjoys because of its position and function in the world of production.

    - Before they dominate economy, and people would **admire them, so give consent to them**

    > An application of this prestige is the consumption society today
    >
    > - People would spend a lot of money in the **brand prestige**
    > - Prestige today is fragmented

- Depends of the affect fo **consent**

  - **Bodily states** related to emotion, and which affect society

- Giving consent to expertise is a practice necessity

- ==In a polarized society, there are **different sets of people regarded as experts** (pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine)==

  - Learn to ask for and to judge evidence

### Democracy in the Digital age

- Alt(ergative)-right
  - Alternative sources of information
  - "Illiberal democracy"
- **Anti-elite attacks** are often racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-environmentalist (white rebellion)
- Liberal democracy is said to be morally flawed and degenerate

## Fear and hope of the digital age

- Coronavirus will into destroy Homo sapiens, but adds to our fear of dangers beyond control
- ==Being **out of control** is an affect typical of the technological age==
- Affective structure of society today
  - **The negative effects of neoliberalism on job security**
  - Stress on the individual causes dissatisfaction, amplified by rapid technological change
  - Loneliness
  - Lack of recognition
  - **Feelings of marginality**
- ==Recognition and Marginality - core and periphery==
  - Recognition is related to social capital (**prestige**)
  - <u>Core</u> - rich countries, urban centres
  - <u>Periphery</u> - poorer countries, rural areas
  - People can feel lack of recognition as a group
  - **Lack of prestige**
  - Look for alternative prestige
  - Can react with anger

## Export information and disinformation

- <u>Disformation</u> - false statements about people
- Conspiracy theories
- Spread form private or secret places
- Amplified by **botse**(auto sending message) - **spared chaos (question prestige)**
  - The non-specific goal is to destabilize an enemy
