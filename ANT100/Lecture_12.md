# **Inequality** & Post-colony

## The postcolony

- ==**<u>Postcolony</u>**==

  1. A former colony or dominated country, now independent

  2. All former colonies, taken together (roughly: the 3rd world or the Global South)(ex. 台湾)

- Inherited means of production from the colonial period, inherited the relations of production

- **Remaining managers** or replaced by **local personnel** without structural change (integrated)

## inequality within and among countries

- <u>GDP</u> - Gross Domestic Product: a measure of wealth produced in a country or other region
- ==**Unequal development**== "riches 26 people own more than the poorer 50%"
- Wealthy middle class is expanding in several **<u>emerging market</u>** countries
  - Raising their GDP statistics, but does not represent the "truth"
    - The **great majority of the very poor continuous to live** there
  - **Inequalities tend to rise** among rich countries

`Who to blame for the unequal development?`

- **Colonial** origins of unequal development: developing *raw material* for their mother country

  - Exposed their **business interests**

- ==**<u>Settler colonies</u>** - where settlers form the colonizing **power move to the colony**==

  - Forager, horticultural, and pastoralist economies were destroyed or **incorporated into industrial stage agricultural system**
  - Land use redefined to amen and into private capital

  > Recent: conflicts over Amazon region in Brazil (indigenous foragers and non-indigenous private farmers)

## Developmental models

- Meant to address global inequality
- Large-scale government projects (dams, new cities...)
  - Typically undertake by the local government and with foreign ad, now less in favour 
  - Less often recently with the rise of independent countries
- Foreign Aid
  - Cash to developing country governments, projects, or associations 
  - Often **strings attached about human right**
  - Criticisms:
    - Does not encourage self-reliance
    - Can be siphoned off through **corruption**
    - The human rights issue selectively applied
- ==Neoliberal market models==
  - Encourages the **free market** (don't *ideally* get *directly* involved)
  - Encourage **open up markets through deregulation** reforms
  - IMF and the World Bank (international, dominated by the USA and the rich West countries)
    - Lend money to countries in need
    - Demand free-market reforms
    - Criticism: austerity measure are cruel; the reforms can crush economic growth
- Microfinance (very small scale, **local lending**) [Muhammad Yunus]
  - ​	Criticism: high interest, coercion, encourages competition, perpetuate gender oppression

## Globalization and beyond

- ==Neoliberal aimed to **break down national barriers, against economic <u>protectionism</u>**==
- Aided the economic outreach of multinational corporations, located mostly in the rich countries of the West and Japan
- **Freedom of movement for capital, but not labor**
  - Movement of capital outsourcing benefits multinational corporations, mainly in the former colonizing countries
  - Movement of labor seldom instituted along the movement of capital

### End of neoliberal globalization

- Protectionism against migrants
- Coronavirus (vaccines in local country first)
- Us-centred capital find serious competition, resorts to protectionism
- Russia 
- China (2nd riches)

- Defending privilege - capitalists seek to support and protect of th national government 
  - **White supremacy**
- <u>Islaophobia</u> - images a vast "radical Islam" conspiracy, migrant "invasion"
- Coronavirus and inequality
  - Metical care is too expensive and/or not accessible to the poorest people
  - Social distancing is impossible in crowded slums
  - Neoliberal polices **undid much the social safety network** of the welfare state
  - Poorer people work in <u>precarious</u> jobs without long-term job security cannot take off work without losing income
