> What's really real

### Reading

- Authoritative definition of religion is hard to come up
  - Includes conceptions of non0human and superhuman beings and forces that are in social and cultural relationships with humans
- Religion is a loose system of different kinds of concepts, roles, and behaviours, each includes
  - "Spiritual" being(s) and/or force(s)
  - Roles for human specialists
  - Behavioural or "ritual" activity
  - Language or religious speech as part of - or itself being - ritual activity

---

### Anthropological attitude to religion

- Goal: not to judge or to establish truth or falsehood

- Recognize the nature and role of religion in its cultural and social context
- Discover what "religion" might mean as a general characteristic of human society
  - Religious is a characteristic of human [in some kind: everyone is religious]
- Can an anthropologist be religious (yes)

## Spirituality & secular society

- ==①organized religion; ②religious beliefs or texts; If don't accept ① or ② (**spiritual** but not religious)==
- **What is or not religious is a matter of arbitrary definition**
- None of the following exists in all religions
  - <u>Dogma</u> - principles that are authorized as true
  - A holy text
  - Natural history (origin and evolution of Nature)
  - "faith", "god", "the victory of good over evil"
- <u>Secular</u> - not religious
- As a **belief**
  - God as described in religion and/or some other as a historical and personal force in the world
  - God is an approximated signifier for the ineffable (cannot be believed or not believed)
- Religion functions in social and historical context
- ==Religion as a means to **transcend culture and society**==

### Judging other religions (identifying "wrong" forms of religion)

- A major concern in <u>abrahamic</u> religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam)

- <u>**Superstition**</u> - aims to obtain favourable result from the sacred sphere (from outside Lacanian "reality") [迷信] 

  > Ex. Believe in lucky numbers that will bring good luck

  - 19th century Christians emphasized the difference between religion and superstition

- **<u>Idolatry</u>** - worshipping signifiers of God as if they were God (the signified) [崇拜]
  
  - Confusing the signifier and the signified
- **<u>Blasphemy</u>** - invoking the presence of God through signs (icons or symbols) in an unauthorized manner, deemed as an insult [亵渎]
- Charges of superstition, idolatry, and blasphemy are levelled at *other* religions (bad things)

### Relation to science, law, education, politics

- *Science* - based on scientific method vs. *Faith* - based on witness the experience

  - Faith is not supported by scholars that faith has the equal weight of faith

- <u>**Fundamentalism**</u> - a *literalist* belief in the correspondence between a holy text (signifier) and God/the truth/the Real (believe that the holy text tells **facts**)

  - ==**Religion != Fundamentalism**==
  - Galileo believes the if there is a contrast between science and religion, then there is a misunderstanding of the Bilbo

  > Evolution vs. Creationism

- (Secular) **law** can conflict with religious law: 

  > Abortion, drawing cartoon of Prophet Muhammad (Religion law vs. Law of rights)

- Religion often supports **power arrangements** (politics)

  - Religion extends social relations to be sacred 
  - The Divine; 

  > God: father **king**

## Lacan's "The Real" and Religion

- Lacan refused to discuss the relationship between his psychoanalysis and religion. Yet, Real-reality relationships recalls that between the divine and "the world" 

  > "For the war against Satan's army and **against the world** and sin. He (Jesus) has enlisted you." (Music by Johann Sebastian Bach)

- ==***Double Belief*** - "I do not believe in God, but I don't want him to know that" (disenchanted world)==

  - <u>Enchanted world</u> -- where Reality is infused with (signifers of) the Real 

    > God and God's presence of the world

  - Bruno Latour: the modern mindset is not free of enchantment

  - Its possible to believe and not believe (at the same time) in enchanted entities or forces 

## Ritual

- Clifford Geertz - "Religion is what is really real"
- ==Old meaning of faith - "**loyalty**"==
  - Balinese kingdoms were organized to produce plays, everyone participates (civic *duty*)
  - In ancient Greeks and Rome also requires participating in rituals as a *duty*
  - Dutch painter Rembrandt (1609 - 1669) got fined for not going to church\

### Rite of Passage

- *Victor Turner*: ritual rites of passage transition form one status to another
  
  - **<u>Liminality</u>** - a powerful, possibility dangerous state **at the threshold**
  
- Inherent challenge to naturalized social categories (child, adult)

- Religious rituals are liminal between the ordinary world and what is beyond: they (re)link reality and the real

- Sprit Possession[ritual]: the spirits are liminal between human culture and society(reality) and the (ineffable unsymbolized) real

  > ###### Trance dance in Bali
  >
  > - Bali - island in Indonesia with its own religion, related to Hinduism 
  > - Spirits position (powerful spirits, enter people)
  > - *Rangda* (mostly evil) and *Barong* (mostly good) - the order of the universe depends on the balance between such forces
  >   - Rangda (often a women-like monster) puts men in a trance and orders them to stab themselves with daggers
  >   - The men oblige, but Barong (often a lion, thought of as male) stops them from harming themselves
  >
  > `Are they really in a trance, or are they faking it?`
  >
  > ​	(Trance is **part of reality** for the participating Balinese)


## Religious identity

- **<u>Religious identity</u>** - a source of cohesion, emotional support, that leads to holy community

- Groups defined by religion find themselves in **conflict** with others

  - Religions intolerance is essentially political intolerance

- **Freedom** from religion

  - Freedom of religion connects to divorcing or distancing religion from the state (in West)
    - 19th to 20th, religion is private, the state either multi-religious or not religious
  - Separation of church and state (USA 1776-1702), Canada is never quite separated

- **<u>Spirituality</u>** - now often means religion without religious identity

- *Unmarked* religious identity (Religious privilege)

  - "Christian" countries recognizes other religions in their own right, not as versions of "religion"

- Religion and Nation can be bring together by 

  >  Divine right of kings; the chosen nation; Israel and the New Israels and New Jerusalem

## Identities as imagined community

- ==<u>Identity</u>: demands loyalty (religion, nation, kin)==
  - All identities are political and it must be practice to function
  - Are **<u>constructed</u>, <u>imagined</u>**, and they change all the time
  - **Identities are multiple, flexible, and changing all the time**
- **<u>Imagined Community</u>** - a groups who feel and act like a community but don't now each other face to face - *Benedict Anderson*
  - Identity often refers to an imagined community (ex. religions, nation communities)

### Nation

- The imagined concept "Nation" fosters unity over class and ethnic divisions (***depoliticizes*** community), its cuts out units of continuity and diversity (Reality out of the Real)
- Its a transcendental signifier - on attempt to signify the Real (Slavoj Zizek)
- The *homogeneous* nation - an *impossible* construction, always in the making
  - The idea of the "nation" suggests *homogeneity* and **borders**
- **<u>Ethnoationalism</u>** - based on imaged common descent (imaged group with common descent)
- **<u>Civic nationalism</u>** - based on residence, citizenship (a country or similar political unit)
- ==***Jus sanguines***(blood)(descent) vs ***Jus soli citizenship***(soil)(territory)==
  - Most citizenship is mixed, but tends towards one fo them
  - Canada has mostly ***jus soli*** 

> ###### Who is "Canadian" (not about citizenship)
>
> - Canada is a multicultural nation
>   - Multiculturalism (multi-ethnic identity) is used to create national unity in English Canada
> - However, ordinary language shows that not everyone is "equally " Canadian
>   - Canadian = a matter of degrees
>   - While would be defined as the "default" Canadian, while other races were not
