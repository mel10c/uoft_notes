# The Economy

### Reading

- Every society has political functions that must be fulfilled
- The various functions can be encapsulated into social order and social control
- Social control is achieved by
  - Externalized controls
  - Internalized controls
- All members of a society are informal agents of social control on each other
- Politics is the exercise of power, with different sources and differ qualities
  - Authority
  - Persuasion 
  - Coercion 
- Depending on the different level of political integration, political systems may be distinguished:
  - Band 
  - Tribe
  - Chiefdom 
  - State
- Socialites must meet and solve recurrent social problems, 2 boarder lines
  - Determination and punishment of guilt
  - Restoration of social harmony
- Politiical independence sometimes bring economic independence (no always)
  - Relations of ownership, control, production, and export did not change hands
  - Consequences of economic dependence
    - Poverty, low standards of living, and mainly rural populations and agricultural production
- General approach of development: modernization theory, dependency/word system theory
- Draw back: displacement of people, social disorganization, declining health and living standards for some, acculturation and deculturation, destruction of the environment

## The base and superstructure

- Human survival requires ways to provision people with food, clothing and ways to change the environment to support human
- Human work in groups to accomplish this 
- Interested in how specific policies function in "the field" and their pursue of ethnographic method
- Results are less generalizable, but ore true to life
- ==Marxist Model==
  - **Base** (relations of production, means of production)
    - Natural resources, tools, mines, factories, offices, infrastructure (concrete things )
  - **Superstructure** (government, family, religion, education, culture)
    - Social relationships required by the economy, different relations of production in different economic systems (**system of production**)
  - Base and superstructure is always correlated
  - **Each economic system correlates with a different kind of superstructure**
  - Economic systems can be arranged historically in terms of appearancez

## Economic systems and their history

### Foraging (hunting, and gathering) 

- Minimal manipulation of the environment [50-40,000 ago]

- **Superstructure - egalitarian(平等主义), informal authority**
- Rudimentary(mainly gender) division of labor
- Flexible gender roles and free sexual behaviour
- Religion: focuses on nature, natural objects may be imaged as living
  - <u>Ojibwa</u> - the story telling stone
  - Rocks in <u>Inuktitut</u> may be grammatically animate (he/she) rather than "it"

> Buffalo hunt before contact with Europeans
>
> Today: Inuit, Indigenous Australians

### Horticulture (slash and burn) [园艺]

- Somewhat greater manipulation of environment[10,000 ago]

- **Superstructure - chief and hierarchy**
- Religion: focus on natural cycles, seasons
  - Harvest rituals
  - Knowledge of solstices; may have a calendar 

>  Wendat of southern Ontario; Haudenosauneee Confederacy (Quebec); Central and South American rain forests; tribal Indians; Indonesian forest

### Pastoralism (herding, nomadism) [游牧]

- Predates horticulture[12, 10,000 ago]

- Nomads - moving over large territory
- Depending on domesticated animal, expands size fo settlements, society produces surplus
- Individual groups(as opposed to the entire community) own more of the means of production
- **Superstructure: male domination, unequal social status, chief or states and empires**
- Can be conflicts with neighbours
- Religion: powerful god(s), often imagined in the sky
  - Abraham/Ibrahim: a pastoralist
- Horsemaznship 

> Mongols (Genghis Khan; Ottomands); Ottomans (Turks)

- Indigenous culture has elements of foraging, horticulture, and pastoralism
- <u>Contact</u> - equal encounter between indigenous plans people and Europeans

- (Intensive) agriculture - relies on tools, environments is actively manipulated [5-6,000 ago]

  - Produces unprecedented surpluses
  - Centralizes accumulation of wealth
  - <u>Peasants</u> - and land loads makes up the society
    - Slavery or serfdom
  - Developed long-distance trade
  - Superstructure: rigid, legalized social stratification = differential access to power and resources
  - <u>Estates</u>(nobility, townsfolk, clergy) and.or <u>casts</u>(endogamous)

  > <u>Feudalism</u>(封建) and <u>vassalage</u>(封臣)

`Why Agricultural & pastoralism can be in conflict with each other, and they cold also corporate`

> Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan
>
> Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda before being colonized

### Industrialism - relations of production (the class system)

#### Industrial revolution - began in 1760 in England

- Completely changed the world
- **Means of production include machines and factories (that produces goods)**
  - Workers used to protest, thinking machines are replacing their jobs
- Relations of production: manufacturing, wage labour
- Unprecedented surpluses - as a whole, its much richer, but inequalities are severe
- Large cities (megalopoles)
- ==**Superstructure: capitalism & money**==
  - <u>Capital</u> - anything one owns that can make them wealtheir
  - <u>Money</u> - financial capital (money makes the world go round)(only starting with industrialism)
  - In austral, capitalist society, (almost) all value cane expressed as money
  - Capital organizes society, its an impersonal force
- Old: gift exchange; New: market exchange
  - Gift: a way to cement society, its an obligation and establishes relationship
  - Market exchange: items are battered for **purely economic value** (typical capitalism)

- Classes are more permeate, and more directly based on money rather than family
- Differences is relative - bering born to privilege or poverty makes a huge difference
- Thomas Piketty - Capital in the Twenty-First Century

- ==Classes includes economic and <u>social capitals</u> well (networks, birth, religion, **education**)==
- Upper class: capitalists or (high) <u>bourgeoisie</u> 
- Upper middle class ("doctors and lawyers")
- (Lower) middle class ("while-collar")
- The working class ("blue-collar") - the largest class in industrial
  - Woking-class organization (unions, socialism)

- Industrial superstructures: 
  - **Market ideology (liberalism[free market]), individualism, nationalism, love marriage**
    -    Liberalism vs **==<u>neo-liberalism</u>==** (take away features of socialist[neoconservative])
    - **Influence of the family is much less**
    - The <u>market</u> - an impersonal, abstract exchange mechanism
      - The meet orders society: the invisible hand (Adam Smith)
      - **Limit government interferences**

### Post-industrial society [1970s]

- Money- powerful personal force
- Means or production: knowledge technology (not just factories or agriculture)
- May require frequent re-educaiton
- The largest class is the middle class
- Added consumer society value
- The rise of "youth culture"
- Globalization (not protection from national state)
- The rich ("developed") countries, services sector as important or more important than manufacturing
- Increasing income disparities
- More unemployed or underemployed "surplus" population
  - Homeless people, urban slums
- Internationalized actives by investors
  - Pros: more efficient production, rise of middle class, uncontrollable migration with others

- All above still exists today
- Indignity - a condition of indigenous people, with similarities world-wide
