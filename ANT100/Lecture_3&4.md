# Signifying Reality

> Dive **under the surface**, and ask question about the "obvious" 

### Readings

- All languages appear to have nouns and verbs
- Humans are programmed to easily process certain kind of language rules
  - Need not be spoken
  - Its independent of the way we express it
- Language need not to be communicated (internal speech)
  - Reflects the way we speak with others
  - Other understanding of the world is aided by both the internal speech & social understanding
- Linguistic and semiotic anthropology are disciplines that study the role of signs in human cultural and society

## ==How signs represent our world (semiotics)==

- Human's reality is constructed by our use of signs

- <u>Signification</u>(verb) - making sense, making signs 
  - Linguistic and non-linguistic signs
- Homo sapiens - "human that knows" (**making sense == to signify**)
- **<u>Semiotics</u>** - study of signs (signifiying)
  - <u>Linguistics</u> - study of language (**part of semiotics**)
  - Other signs (semiotics proper)

## The form fo signs (signifier and the signified)

- Classic ("*Saussurean*") View of Signification (Ferdinand de Saussure)
  - **<u>Signifier</u>** - has some **physical property**(audio, visual, writing)
  - **<u>Signified</u>** - in material (not in semiotic language, **ordinary language**)

### Sign = Signifier + Signified (3 quality of signs, a sign can have more than one qualities)

- ==<u>Icon</u>== - share some of their physical form (shape, sound...

  > Ex. Picture of a person -> person

- ==<u>Index</u>== - do not share any of their form(sound/look) with the referent - has **existential relationships** with its referent

  > Ex. Moose poo -> Moose
  >
  > Ex. "Smoke" and "Fire" is neither arbitrary(pure convention) nor iconic (has no image)

- ==<u>Symbol</u>== - have ***arbitrary*** relation to signified (*referent*) - **no existential relationship** [暗喻]

  > Ex. Cross -> signifies England

  - Connected only via systems of signification (eg. Language)
  - Arbitrary is opposite of *motivated*（icons & index is motivated)
  - Most words are arbitrary

  - Index has existential relationship while symbols don't

>###### Differentiating between it
>
>- Would you get the meaning without learning the a code or a language? (No -> symbol)
>
>- Can you say in ordinary talk that the sign is what it stands for? (Yes -> Icon)
>
>- The sign indicates but isn't what it stands for (Index)

## Denotation and Connotation

- <u>==Denotation==</u> - what a sign (including linguistics signs like words) means **literally**
- <u>==Connotation==</u> - what it means not literally, what it **implies** 
  - ***Linguistic sign*** is a type fo connotation (eg. Word, phrase, sentence)
  - Connotations vary more from person to person than denotation 
  - Connotations are powerful but not easily open to argument
  - "What cannot be said is greater than what can be saide"

## Reality and The Real

- ==<u>**Reality**</u> - how we understand The Real (in social science *jargon*) - we are well advised to live in it==
  - **Reality is socially constructed** - Its what's verifiable and *makes sense to us*
    - Constructed by society (most reality come acres through the finer of signs and language)
  - The concept might be very real, but could be false
  - Reality vs irreality (truth from lies / falsehood / false news)

> ###### Colour as social construct
>
> - Green and blue has no distinction in old Chinese and English
> - The colour spectrum is continuous, it's language that divides it into units
>
> ###### Alternate Realities 
>
> - Content creators could manipulate "reality" with what they were presenting

### Whorf Hypothesis

- Benjamin Lee Whorf (not possible to prove it)
- Each **language decisively influences the way its speaker think** (different language construct different realities) - linguistic relativity

> Ex. Pasted tense represents cultural's view of time

## Self as construct

- Theory: Our concept of having a self (ego) is not entirely given by nature
  - **Constructed in society**, by sings, especially language
  - There is a continuum our of which language delineates a distinguiable "self"
  - Experiences and actions are united in the one distinct whole we call "I"

### ==Jacques Lacan reinterpreted Freud stages of the development of self==

- **Real** -> **Imaginary** (mirror stage) -> **Symbolic** (accomplished through languages)
- <u>Real</u> (ego not yet formed) - the real is undifferentiated, no signs, uncategorized experience
  - **No boundary** between self and the world (does not know where she begins and ends)
- <u>Imaginary</u> (ego forms) - world is perceived **without words**, ego image is **supported by society**
  - Corresponds to the icon (image rather than words, icon is the most typical image sign)
  - Image vs. The word
- <u>Symbolic</u> (language appears) - the world is **differentiated into categories marked by signifiers**
  - Gets a system that has thousands and categories that separates the reality
  - Ego learns to understand "I" as part of a society, in relation to "you"
  - Characteristics (systematic, socially constructed and sanctioned(approved), not given by nature, is not THE REAL, but its the reality)

- We are both "I" and "you" to ourselves
  - One party coaches the other, it represents society
